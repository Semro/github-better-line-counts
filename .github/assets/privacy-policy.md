# Privacy Policy

The extension doesn't upload or share any data with anyone ever. The only HTTP requests the extension makes are to GitHub's API (api.github.com).

That means the extension does not:

- Upload any form of usage stats
- Collect bug reports

The extension stores an optional GitHub personal access token, used to calculate the line counts of private repos.

> The extension is open source. Clone it and do a global search for "githubPat" to see how this token is used. Litterally just for authentication with GitHub's API.

So yeah. The Chrome Web Store needed this document to publish the extension, but as you can see, the extension doesn't collect any data.
